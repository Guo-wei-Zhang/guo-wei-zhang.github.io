## Education

In 2020, I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT. My advisor was
[Professor Daniel Sanchez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez).

In 2016, I received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT.

In 2014, I earned a Bachelor Degree in Microelectronics and a Second Bachelor Degree in Economics from Tsinghua University.

I was an exchange student at University of Southern California in 2013, where I worked with
[Professor Peter Beerel](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Beerel/Peter).
